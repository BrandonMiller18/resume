			<p>Welcome to what is probably the millionth iteration of my resume website. If you are reading this, it means I have finally gotten this bad boy to a place where I am happy enough to launch it (I've only owned the domain for over a year...)! Jokes aside, I started this project with one goal: LEARN. Spoiler alert: I have learned a lot!</p>
			<p>This site is built using the Python web-framework, Flask. I use the SQLAlchemy API to store and retrieve data from an SQLite database. All the HTML and CSS is completely custom (no bootstrap). Ok, maybe not completely custom - any sane person knows that Reddit and Stack Overflow are necessary for any project.</p>
			<p>The site you are viewing now is not a final product, and likely never will be. This is where I learn and experiment. This is my professional classroom. Take a look around...</p>

				<p>The NHL Companion is a site I built which allows you to follow your favorite NHL team's game. The app plays your team's goal horn when your team scores. </p>
				<p>It uses the NHL's public API to retrieve data and is built using Flask as the framework and SocketIO to manage the communication from server to client. The code is available on my GitHub.</p>
